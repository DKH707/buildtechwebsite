- **Contact Information**: Easy ways for potential clients to reach out
- **About Me**: Professional and Academic background, expertise, and a sneak peek into my other passions
- **Responsive Design**: I try to develop for all screen sizes and resolutions, this site is a testament of that

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI/Plus
- **Deployment**: Vercel for CI/CD as well as hosting
